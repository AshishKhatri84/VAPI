# 🎙️ I-Bot: AI Voice Interview Agent

A conversational AI voice agent built for the 100x Engineers assessment round that answers interview questions on my behalf - demonstrating production-ready AI that replaces human work, not just assists it.

**Talk to me through AI:** This bot conducts natural interviews as if you're speaking directly with me, adapting to both structured questions and casual conversation.
